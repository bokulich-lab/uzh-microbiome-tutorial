    "The Google Colab notebook environment will interpret any command as Python code by default. If we want to run bash commands we will have to prefix them by `!`. So any command you see with a leading `!` is a bash command and if you wanted to run it in your terminal you would omit the leading `!`. For example, if in the Colab notebook you ran `!wget` you would just run `wget` in your terminal. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we use the `!` prefix because we run all QIIME 2 commands using the [`q2cli`](https://github.com/qiime2/q2cli/) (QIIME 2 command-line interface).

    "## Predicting categorical data\n",
    "\n",
    "*Supervised learning classifiers* predict the categorical metadata classes of unlabeled samples by learning the composition of labeled training samples. For example, we may use a classifier to diagnose or predict disease susceptibility based on stool microbiome composition, or predict sample type as a function of the sequence variants, microbial taxa, or metabolites detected in a sample. In this tutorial, we will use the read processing tutorial data to train a classifier that predicts body site from which a sample was collected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sections:\n",
    "1. Train and test a categorical classifier\n",
    "2. Optimize feature selection\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training/testing classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "We will train and test a classifier that predicts which body site a sample originated from, based on its microbial composition. We will do so using the `classify-samples` pipeline, which performs a series of steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The input samples are randomly split into a `training` set and a `test` set. The test set is held out until the end of the pipeline, allowing us to test accuracy on a set of samples that was not used for model training. The fraction of input samples to include in the test set is adjusted with the `--p-test-size` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We train the learning model using the training set samples. The model is trained to predict a specific `target` value for each sample (contained in a metadata column) based on the feature data associated with that sample. A range of different estimators can be selected using the `estimator` parameter; more details on individual estimators can be found in the [scikit-learn documentation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html) (not sure which to choose? See the [estimator selection flowchart](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html)).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. K-fold [cross-validation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)) is performed during automatic feature selection and parameter optimization steps to tune the model. Five-fold cross-validation is performed by default, and this value can be adjusted using the `--p-cv` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The trained model is used to predict the target values for each test sample, based on the feature data associated with that sample, and predict class probabilities for each sample. Class probabilities are the likelihood that a sample belongs to each class (i.e., group of samples with the same `target` value).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Model accuracy is calculated by comparing each test sampleâ€™s predicted value to the true value for that sample."
