# QIIME 2 Tutorial: Read Processing and Machine Learning

This repository contains materials accompanying the workshop **Microbiome-Based Tools: From Research to Application**.

These notebooks describe simplified analyses of microbiome datasets using the with the bioinformatics platform [QIIME 2](https://qiime2.org/). 16S rRNA sequence data are used to evaluate bacterial composition of several different ecosystems; they are subsequently used to train and evaluate machine learning models. To learn more about the QIIME 2 project and applications in microbiome research, visit https://qiime2.org/.

These analysis notebooks were adapted from the [QIIME 2 Moving Pictures tutorial](https://docs.qiime2.org/2023.9/tutorials/moving-pictures/) and [`q2-sample-classifier` tutorial](https://docs.qiime2.org/2023.9/tutorials/sample-classifier/). A study based on these samples was originally published in [Caporaso et al. (2011)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21624126).
