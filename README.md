# QIIME 2 Tutorials: Read Processing and Machine Learning

This repository contains materials accompanying the workshop **Microbiome-Based Tools: From Research to Application**. To jump directly to the analysis notebooks, click on the badges for the corresponding tutorials below.

These notebooks describe simplified analyses of microbiome datasets using the with the bioinformatics platform [QIIME 2](https://qiime2.org/). To learn more about the QIIME 2 project and applications in microbiome research, visit https://qiime2.org/.

## Read processing tutorial
[![Read Processing (Colab)](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/bokulich-lab/uzh-microbiome-workshop/blob/main/01_read_processing.ipynb)

In this notebook, we use 16S rRNA sequence data to evaluate bacterial composition of sample ecosystems. To launch, click on the badge above.

These analysis notebooks were adapted from the [QIIME 2 Moving Pictures tutorial](https://docs.qiime2.org/2023.9/tutorials/moving-pictures/) and [`q2-sample-classifier` tutorial](https://docs.qiime2.org/2023.9/tutorials/sample-classifier/). A study based on these samples was originally published in [Caporaso et al. (2011)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21624126).
